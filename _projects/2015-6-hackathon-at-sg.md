### The Brief
[Hackathon@SG ‪2015](https://ideas.ecitizen.gov.sg/a/pages/hackathon-at-sg-2015) is possibly the largest hackathon ever held in Singapore with a turnout of over 1,100 from all walks of life such as healthcare professionals, entrepreneurs, programmers, designers and students. The competition is jointly organized by Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and IT Standards Committee on 25-26 July‬ to tackle urban challenges impacting Singapore and participate in Smart Nation building efforts. 

As one of the challenge sponsors, Singapore Land Authority (SLA) is seeking a geospatial-enabled platform or application to promote volunteerism and caring communities through sharing of geo-data. Driven by this needs, we are looking to address following questions:

- How might we enable more people participate in community volunteerism?
- How might we enable people in need to get timely and responsive help?

### Idea: Project GrabHelp
*Universal Community Volunteerism*

Using SMS as Communication Platform, GrabHelp locates and connects those who needs help with nearby community of volunteers in near real-time. We simplify the process of requesting help via SMS just by using name, needs and location keyword. GrabHelp will then find available and notify nearby volunteers for acknowledgement. Upon consent from both parties, relevant contact details is then revealed.
