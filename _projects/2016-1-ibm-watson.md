StoryWeaver is subscription based service that gives new dynamic to traditional methods of organizing and reminiscing photo collections through conversational based interface. It empowers seniors and families who are overwhelmed with their photo collections. Using Watson Cognitive Computing capabilities, it removes manual and laborious effort to sift, find, curate and annotate important life moments.

Our goal is to organize, annotate, and narrate lifetime worth of photo collections effortlessly using following Watson API:

  * Watson Visual Recognition to automatically analyze images in order to recognize settings, objects, events and organize them into semantic categories without a time-consuming and subjective process that often leads to incomplete and inconsistent annotation. 
  * Watson Visual Insights to obtain personalized insights related to user interests, activities and life events. 
  * Watson Dialog Service to spark natural and contextual conversation topics for recalling key events in user’s life and draw out more meaningful details. 
  * Watson Cognitive Speech to simplify information display, remove cumbersome navigation structures, and reduce multitude of steps into simple voice commands. It is also being used to transcribe speech into annotation text that could be used to enhance Watson cognitive analysis further. 

Our target users are seniors and families who are often overwhelmed with their photo collections. They recognize the importance of positive memories and experiences for well-being. They desire to build strong family connections through stories and shared experiences, but are often plagued with guilt and anxiety for not being able to organize their photos.
