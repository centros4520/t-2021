As practitioners in Social Innovation sectors, they both believe that all change, big or small, starts with a conversation. Through this training, they help participants make sense of their own narratives, grow new capacity to response and build new possibilities by exploring different kind of conversations with self and others. It also aims to bring new awareness on relationship of body, emotion and language based on ontological coaching and organisational development frameworks. 

In a larger context, this training is about inspiring participants to use more empathetic approach to address complex problems we face as a society and play a part in building Singapore’s social and emotional capital.
